    self.discountRate = 0.95


Lets changed lower as 0.3

Lost, cause the distance to capsule is not float. Restart



After 5 times training,
we can now get foods and put it back home. Ignore the ghost because we are not using it.


We use a large time limit to ensure we can meet food and ghost before we get into competation

try 20 more training lets see the result
result as image, all win the do nothing agent
distanceToFood:12.1646184076;distanceToCapsule:63.2282666192;distanceToGhost:5.35128023918;returnHome:24.7299335371
we can see, Now Food, capsule, return home after taken food is being perfect.
But ghost distance is weird.
because we are not eabling it

Problem: ghost weight should be more important, however when dead ghost weight becomes not important


Then, let us enable the defend function
--alpha beta///
